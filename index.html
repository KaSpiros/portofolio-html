              Hello! I'm Spiros, a passionate SRE and DevOps engineer with a
              strong background in software development and ML. I like to build
              solutions that people understand and find useful. I have a knack
              for simplifying complex problems and creating efficient, scalable
              systems. My journey in tech has been driven by a desire to break
              things in order to understand how they work.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe in the power of simplicity and minimalism in design,
              focusing on what truly matters to create solutions that users
              understand.

          <h3>MSc in Big Data Technologies</h3>
          <p><em>Glasgow Caledonian, 2020/21, Distinction</em></p>
          <p>
            During my degree, I worked with various big data technologies
            including GCP services for data storage and analysis, as well as
            Python libraries like Pandas and Numpy. My dissertation focused on
            using machine learning to predict how a system would perform based
            on its setup. I used Python for data analysis and model building,
            then developed a REST API using NodeJS and Express, along with a
            React + Redux web app to present the results. The project was a
            valuable hands-on experience in full-stack development, machine
            learning, and working with large-scale data tools.

          <h3>BSc in Computer Science</h3>
          <p><em>Glasgow Caledonian, 2016/20, 1st Class Degree</em></p>
          <p>
            I studied topics like software engineering, web development, and
            database design. I built several projects, including a web app using
            JavaScript and MySQL, which gave me hands-on experience in software
            development. I also worked on a mobile app using React, NodeJS,
            Kotlin, and Java, which helped me gain full-stack and some mobile
            development experience.
